# GENERAL INFO

SoftTrans is an English to French Neural Machine Translation system, specially designed for translating software product descriptions provided on LinkedIn webpages. This work is a collaboration between ADAPT Centre (Ireland) and LinkedIn corporation (Ireland). The system is trained on a combination of several corpora which are then filtered using keyBERT (****) and LASER (**) toolkits, and tuned on an in-domain development data set.
